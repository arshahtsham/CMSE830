Problem 4. Web App Visualization: Last week you built your first DS web app using `streamlit`. The web app used the Italian wine dataset from `sklearn` and made the plot using a visualization library called `Altair`. Modify your code to:
* read the iris dataset from Seaborn,
* rather than using `Altair`, use `Plotly`,
* the interactive plot should be a 3D scatter plot,
* update the text to describe this dataset.

You already know how to get datasets from Seaborn. You may not have encountered `Plotly` before, however.

[Here](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/charts/st.plotly_chart) is how `Plotly` works with `streamlit`. [Read this page](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/charts) to see all of the options that are available to you. For your project, you can choose from among all of these options!

You will make many choices when you build your web app for your midterm project. Here we are exploring:
* using different datasets,
* using different visualization libraries,

all within `streamlit`. Consider trying other datasets (e.g., mpg) and other visualization libraries (e.g., matplotlib) now.
